<p>David E. Shell maintains an active landlord-tenant practice.</p><p>While our emphasis is representing property owners and managers (&quot;Landlords&quot;), we are not adverse to representing tenants in appropriate cases where there is no danger of conflict of interest.  However, tenants need to understand there is a charge for all services.  Ordinarily, tenants are better off using the assistance of Legal Services of Northern California who offer assistance and legal advice without charge.  The telephone number and address of Legal Services of Northern Califrornia is available in the local telephone directory.</p><p>Timeliness is very important in landlord-tenant matters.  In order to expedite the process, our standard landlord retainer agreement is attached for downloading and printing.  We require a deposit of money and a signed retainer agreement  to begin work on a case along with a copy of any/all written agreements, prior notices and any other relevant items, such as correspondence and photographs, if applicable.</p><p><a href="files/fee_agreement.pdf">Click here to download and print our Fee Agreement Form (pdf).</a></p>
