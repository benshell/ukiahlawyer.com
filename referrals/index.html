<p>We receive regular inquiries as to recommended names of other attorneys handling different types of law in the Ukiah area.</p><p>It is always difficult to recommend attorneys without being thoroughly familiar with the quality of their work. The best source of locating competent counsel is Martindale Hubbell who often rates qualifying attorneys.   Possible ratings are CV, BV, and AV.   C means good to high legal ability based on peer review; B means high to very high; A means very high to preeminent.   V means very high ethical standards.   Even a rating of &quot;C&quot; (contrary to traditional school grades) is considered very good and the majority of attorneys do not achieve this grade or any rating at all!</p><p>Martindle Hubbell has a <a href="http://www.martindale.com/xp/Martindale/Lawyer_Locator/Search_Lawyer_Locator/search_result.xml?PG=0&STYPE=P&search=0&PAREA=&SET=&CN=Ukiah&CTY=Mendocino&STS=5&CRY=1&LNG=&LSCH=&MTY=&MTR=&FSZ=&BR=">web site</a> but unfortunately only shows attorneys who have paid for advertising unless you enter a specific attorney's name.   If you type the specific name, it will give you the rating, if any, but not address and telephone number unless they have paid for advertising.   Consulting Martindale Hubbell's printed materials is best because you can quickly locate all local attorneys as well as determine who is rated and who is not. The Mendocino County Law Library (located in the Mendocino County Courthouse in Ukiah) like most public law libraries contains a recent edition of Martindale Hubbell for public use.</p>
