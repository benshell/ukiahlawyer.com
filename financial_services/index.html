<p>We offer general business services such as routine collection matters. We can help you do a wage garnishment or levy on property or other assets even if you obtained a judgment in small claims court.  Financial matters frequently involve tax issues and we do not generally render tax advice.  Clients are always advised to obtain the services of a C.P.A. or other competent tax professional.</p>
