<p>The Law Office of David E. Shell has closed due to retirement, effective December 31, 2016.</p>

<p>David E. Shell (and his long time assistant, Lori) are each joining their respective spouses (who are already retired) and starting a new phase in the adventure called life.</p>

<p>On this website, you will find a list of attorneys who may be able to handle cases for you. Of course, these are only suggested names based on the type of law we have practiced. There are many other attorneys in the Ukiah area who may also be willing to handle the type of work we have done in the past and this list is only intended as a starting point. You should call more than one attorney, if possible, before making a decision as to whom to use. We cannot and do not guarantee the work of any other attorney. As in any case, you should carefully evaluate an attorney before retaining them, look at the quality of their work as well as their fees, ask them how charges will be based, and how do they itemize charges in detail. If possible, try to get a reference from a satisfied client who has already used them. Try to get assurances that they will finish a job that they start in a timely manner.</p>

<p>If you find an attorney who you think is good -- or one that is unsatisfactory -- in the areas in which we practiced, please let us know so we can consider that in future listings on this website.</p>

<p>We have also left links on this website as to various legal research tools which you may wish to use.</p>

<p>If you are a past client and need to contact us regarding an old matter, feel free to do so by e-mailing to  &#100;&#097;&#118;&#105;&#100;&#064;&#117;&#107;&#105;&#097;&#104;&#108;&#097;&#119;&#121;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;. We do not promise an instantaneous response but we will try to get back to you when possible.</p>

<p>Thank you again for many years of a meaningful career. We wish you all the best for the future.</p>
