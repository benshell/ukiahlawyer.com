<p>Click on any of the buttons shown to the left for more information about the major categories we handle.</p><p>We try to flat rate as many services as possible.</p><p>To obtain a current copy of our price brochure, call or write us at the address shown on our site home page.  Services not shown are charged for at the rate of $200 to $250 per hour of attorney's time. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the current rate is $200 per hour except for actual trial time which is charged the higher rate. A charge may also be made for secretary/legal assistant time at the rate of $65.00 per hour, as where lawyer time does not accurately reflect the actual work and effort involved.</p><p>Flat rated services should be paid in advance. Hourly services are billed and payable monthly. A deposit of most or all of the total anticipated fee is normally expected along with anticipated costs prior to beginning work. This helps keep our overhead low and enables us to serve you more effectively. The minimum deposit for most cases involving litigation (except routine collection matters, Unlawful Detainers, and flat rated matters) is $2,500.</p><p>Prices are subject to change. While we endeavor to maintain the prices quoted in our price list as long as possible, we reserve the right to increase charges in the event of unforeseen or unusual circumstances. An extra charge for post-drafting negotiations with the other side or opposing counsel is expected. We also reserve the right to refuse acceptance of cases altogether, with or without any explanation.</p><h4>Consultations and Office Calls</h4><p>In order to encourage existing and prospective clients to discuss potential problems in advance, we offer reduced rates on routine office visits.</p><p>There is a charge of $75.00 for initial consultations.</p><p align="left">Other routine questions, subsequent consultations, and similar discussions lasting one-third hour or less, not involving specific legal work nor pending matters being handled by us are normally charged a minimum flat rate of $40 if paid at time of consultation ($50 if billing is required).</p><p>Longer consultations are charged by the hour at our normal hourly rate.</p><p>Telephone consultation calls are charged at the same rate as office visits.</p><p>Special arrangements may be made for house calls or consultations after normal working hours at an additional charge.</p>
