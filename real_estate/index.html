<p>David E. Shell regularly provides legal assistance for buyers and sellers in purchase or sale of real property, including drafting and preparation of real estate sales agreement and review of escrow and title documents.   We never represent both sides in a transaction due to inherent conflicts of interest.  Charges vary but are typically far less than a Real Estate Broker would charge.  Call for current rates or request a copy of our fee schedule.</p><p>David E. Shell also prepares Options to Purchase (with or without Lease combined) and handles Uncontested Quiet Title actions, preparation of simple deeds, assignments, homesteads, or similar documents, preparation of notes and deeds of trust, easement agreements and C.C.2941.7 Bond Procedures to clear lost notes.</p><p>Our emphasis is transactional matters and short cause court cases rather than protracted litigation.  We generally recommend obtaining litigation counsel for trials involving more than one-half day in court.</p>
